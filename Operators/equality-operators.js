//Equality Operators

let var1 = 5;
let var2 = "5";

//this condition is true because it coerces the string to a number
console.log("1" == 1); //output: true
console.log("1" != 1); //output: false

//this condition is false as it type checks - a string isn't equal to a number
console.log("1" === 1); //output: false
console.log("1" !== 1); //output: true
